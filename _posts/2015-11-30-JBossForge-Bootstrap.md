Just a short one today. Last week i stumbled upon [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and when i saw it i instantly
 had to think of [JBossForge](http://forge.jboss.org/). So here is my little example (it seems that i am not the best typer ;))

 * Full JavaEE 7 CRUD project with Maven as build system
 * With one JPA entity (validation inclusive) mapped to H2 database
 * JAX-RS interface via JSON
 * JSF UI

[![JBossForge Wildfly](/public/images/forgeasciinema.jpg)](https://asciinema.org/a/30879/)

The generated project can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/AlexBischof/JbossForgeAsciinema).
